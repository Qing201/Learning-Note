Problem 2:
Briefly explain (if true) or give a counterexample (if false): If, in a stable matching instance, there is a pair $(m,w)$ such that $m$ is $w$’s first choice and $w$ is $m$’s first choice, then $m$ and $w$ are matched to each other in every stable solution.

**True**

When in a stable Matching instance, there are no two element in diffent set who would both rather have each other than their current partners. When $m$ is $w$'s first choice and also $w$ is $m$'s first choice. If $m$ is paired with another element. It will always prefer to have $w$ rather than current partner. Same as $w$. Therefore, the statement is true.
