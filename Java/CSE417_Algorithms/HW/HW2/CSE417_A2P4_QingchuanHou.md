Problem 4:

Give an algorithm that finds a simple cycle in an undirected graph, if it has one, or reports that it does not. A “simple cycle” is a list of vertices, with no vertex repeated, such that there is an edge connecting each successive pair of vertices, and one connecting the last to the first. A graph may have many cycles; only report one.

mark all nodes undiscoverd
    for node a in all node:
        if undiscoverd
            for all b in a's connect nodes
            
        if alldiscoved
