**Upper Bounds**: 
$f(n)$ is $ O (g(n))$ if there is a constant $c > 0$ so that $f(n)$ is eventually always  $ \le c g(n) $

**Lower Bounds**:
$f(n)$ is $\Omega (g(n))$ if there is a constant $c > 0$ so that $f(n)$ is eventually always  $ \ge c g(n) $

**Both:**
$f(n)$ is $\Theta (g(n))$ if there is are constants $c1, c2 > 0$ so that eventually always $c_1g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2g(n)$

## Class 3

**Logarithms**
Change-of=base formula:
$$ log_a(x) = \frac{log_b(x)}{log_b(a)}$$
$$ log_b(a) * log_a(x) = log_b(x)$$

For all $x>0$, *(no mater how small)* $log \ n =O(n^x)$
