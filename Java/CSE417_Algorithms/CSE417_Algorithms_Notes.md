## Week 1:

**Upper Bounds**: 
$f(n)$ is $ O (g(n))$ if there is a constant $c > 0$ so that $f(n)$ is eventually always  $ \le g(n) $

**Lower Bounds**:
$f(n)$ is $\Omega (g(n))$ if there is a constant $c > 0$ so that $f(n)$ is eventually always  $ \ge g(n) $

**Both:**
$f(n)$ is $\Theta (g(n))$ if there is are constants $c1, c2 > 0$ so that eventually always $c_1g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2g(n)$
